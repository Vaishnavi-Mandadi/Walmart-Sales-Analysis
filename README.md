# **Walmart Sales Analysis and Prediction**

## **Overview**
This repository contains the work and findings of Group 5 for the "Data Mining Business Analytics" course at Barton School of Business. Our project focuses on analyzing and predicting Walmart's sales using a dataset from Kaggle. The analysis covers data from 45 Walmart stores across various states from 2010 to 2012, examining factors such as store number, sales date, holiday events, temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment rates.

## **Project Scope**
Data Pre-processing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.

Exploratory Analysis: Examining relationships between various factors and weekly sales.

Model Development: Implementing Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree models for sales prediction.

Evaluation: Comparing the performance of the models based on various metrics.

## **Repository Contents**
Dataset: The original dataset from Kaggle, comprising sales data from 45 Walmart stores.
Analysis Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks detailing the data pre-processing, exploratory analysis, and model development.
Results and Figures: Visualizations and results from the analysis, including model comparisons and insights.

## **Key Insights**
Analysis of sales trends over the years and across different stores.
Impact of holidays, temperature, CPI, fuel price, and unemployment on sales.
Model comparisons to identify the most accurate method for sales prediction.
